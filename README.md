Music Mood Classification Engine:
Project Description: The goal of this project is to build an NLP engine that can analyze the mood of a given music track based on its lyrics. The engine will use natural language processing techniques such as sentiment analysis and topic modeling to identify the mood of the lyrics as happy, sad, angry, or neutral. The engine can be used by music streaming services to provide personalized music recommendations based on the user's mood.


Steps:

Collect and preprocess a dataset of song lyrics labeled with their mood
Develop an NLP model for sentiment analysis and topic modeling
Train and test the model on the dataset
Implement a music mood classification framework that uses the model to analyze the mood of a given song
Deploy the music mood classification engine as a REST API

Dataset collection and preprocessing:

```
import csv

with open('dataset.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        # preprocess lyrics and mood label
        lyrics = preprocess_text(row[0])
        mood = row[1]
        # save lyrics and mood label to dataset
        save_to_dataset(lyrics, mood)
```
